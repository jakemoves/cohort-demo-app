# Cohort iOS Demo App

## Disclaimers
This is pre-alpha. Don't @ me about hardcoding CocoaPods into this demo.

## Requirements
Xcode v8 or v9
iOS devices running iOS 10 or 11

## Getting started
- clone this repo into a folder on your Mac
- double-click 'CohortClient.xcworkspace' to open it in XCode
- optional: in the Project Navigator, select CohortClient.xcodeproj and press `delete`
- plug in an iOS device running iOS 10 or 11
- in the Scheme dropdown, select the device that's plugged in
- hit the play ('Build and Run') button to build the demo app and load it on your device
